NonWordTranscription
====================

Praat code for transcribing the NWR recordings collected as a part of the Learning To Talk project.

To do:
------
* Update vowel scoring so that diphthongs are scored for frontness and height using the first vowel in the diphthong.
* Update prosody scoring to score 1 point for not deleting segments and 1 point for not inserting segments. We also need to note whether a vowel was inserted, because an inserted vowel would definitely affect the syllable structure in the production.
